# Frozen Stars as a Unified Source of Cosmic Structure and Acceleration

A unified explanation for dark matter and dark energy may emerge from frozen stars, ultracompact, horizonless objects. If two distinct populations exist—one primordial (Population A) acting as cold dark matter and another forming post-recombination (Population B) driving late-time acceleration—this framework naturally accounts for structure formation and an evolving equation of state without a cosmological constant. Within Buchert’s formalism, the growth of Population B alters the expansion rate via gravitational backreaction, inducing a Hubble dipole and contributing to the CMB hemispherical asymmetry. Population A deepens gravitational wells, accelerating early structure formation. The model aligns with cosmic equation of state constraints, suggesting acceleration as an emergent gravitational effect rather than vacuum energy.
